To import Book data into your mongoDB database
Make sure MongoDB is running then 
run 'cmd /c --% mongo bookAPI < bookJson.js' from the command line

because of '<':
"cmd" invokes cmd.exe, which knows what you mean by <
"/c" tells cmd.exe to process one command following on the command lineand then exit.
"--%" tells PowerShell to leave the rest of the command line alone, so that cmd.exe can deal with the < redirection.
